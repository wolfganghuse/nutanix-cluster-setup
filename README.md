# Nutanix Setup Scripts


ONE-LINE INSTALL
--------------------

Assumes the included settings (see above) are OK for your environment - this is unlikely to work!  Be warned!  :)
Normal workflow would be forking and creating a new Branch and adjusting settings for your env

**Example use from a Nutanix CVM:**
#curl --remote-name --location https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wolfganghuse/nutanix-cluster-setup/master/bootstrap.sh && sh ${_##*/}
